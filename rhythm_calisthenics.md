# Rhythm Calisthenics

This document describes a possible script for developing flowing rhythmic motion.

I have in mind something like an animated '5-minute abs!' kinda thing.

It is inspired by the *Jump Right In Recorder Teacher's Guide* 'teaching procedures' section, 'Coordination and Rhythm Readiness Activities'.

## Script

1. "Let's practice rhythmic motion."
1. "First let's get a beat going."
1. (Start a beat at 100 BPM)
1. "Motion is essential to feeling rhythm."
1. "Motion means more than just tapping your toe or your finger."
1. "When you move, you want to get your whole body involved. You want to feel yourself flow."
1. "Let's move our arms first."
1. "Rest your elbows on your lap or a table."
1. (Show picture of resting elbows)
1. "Bend your arms at the elbows at the same time to the beat"
1. (Show arm bending animation)
1. "Now, bend one arm down and the other up to the beat"
1. (Show arm bending animation)
1. "Now let's stand up and swing our arms."
1. "Swing your arms back and forth, together, to the beat."
1. (Show arm swinging animation)
1. "Now Swing your arms back and forth, alternating, to the beat."
1. (Show arm swinging animation)
1. "Now let's sit down and move our body."
1. "Sway your upper body side-to-side, like a tree in the wind."
1. (Show swaying animation)
1. "Let's move our feet. Lift your heels up and down together, with the beat."
1. (Show foot animation)
1. "Now lift your heels opposite to each other."
1. (Show foot animation)
1. "Now let's move our arms and feet."
1. "Move your arms and feet together."
1. (Show animation)
1. "Let's stand up again. Rock in place, shift your weight from foot to the other."
1. (Show animation)
1. "Now, keep rocking. But now tap duple microbeats with your arms and hands."
1. (Show animation)
1. "Now, try tapping triple microbeats with your just hands. Keep rocking."
1. (Show animation)
1. "Now, sit down again. Move your heels to the macrobeats, and your arms and hands to tap microbeats."

## Notes
Perhaps it's better to not use any words at all. Or many fewer words. And just show the animations. Get out of the left-brain.
