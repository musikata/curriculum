# Rhythm Calisthenics

This document describes a possible script for developing flowing rhythmic motion.

I have in mind something like an animated '5-minute abs!' kinda thing.

It is inspired by the *Jump Right In Recorder Teacher's Guide* 'teaching procedures' section, 'Coordination and Rhythm Readiness Activities'.

## Script

1. Rhythm is part music, rhythm is part of life.
1. When you breathe, you breathe in rhythm.
1. Breathe in, breathe out.
1. (Picture of breathing)
1. When your heart beats, it beats in rhythm.
1. Feel your heart beat.
1. (Picture of hand over heart)
1. Rhythm is time, weight, flow, and space.
1. Rhythm is the pulse of music.
1. Did you know: crickets have rhythm. The speed of a cricket's chirps is related to the temperature.
1. How do we learn rhythm?
1. We train. We move.
1. Motion is essential to feeling rhythm.
1. Motion means more than just tapping your toe or your finger.
1. When you move, you want to get your whole body involved. You want to feel yourself flow.
1. Here are some exercises you can do.
1. Try do them for just a few minutes, every day.
1. First let's get a beat.
1. (Start a beat at 100 BPM)
1. "Let's move our arms first."
1. "Rest your elbows on your lap or a table. Bend your arms up and down, together, to the beat."
1. (Show picture of resting elbows and arms)
1. Count 8 bends.
1. Now, bend your arms opposite to each other, to the beat. One arm up, the other arm down."
1. (Show picture of resting elbows and arms)
1. Count 8 bends.
1. "Now let's stand up and swing our arms."
1. "Swing your arms back and forth, together, to the beat."
1. (Show arm swinging animation)
1. "Now Swing your arms back and forth, opposite, to the beat."
1. (Show arm swinging animation)
1. "Now let's sit down and move our body."
1. "Sway your upper body side-to-side, like a tree in the wind."
1. (Show swaying animation)
1. "Let's move our feet. Lift your heels up and down together, with the beat."
1. (Show foot animation)
1. "Now lift your heels opposite to each other."
1. (Show foot animation)
1. "Now let's move our arms and feet."
1. "Move your arms and feet together."
1. (Show animation)
1. "Let's stand up again. Rock in place, shift your weight from foot to the other."
1. (Show animation)
1. "Now, keep rocking. But now tap duple microbeats with your arms and hands."
1. (Show animation)
1. "Now, try tapping triple microbeats with your just hands. Keep rocking."
1. (Show animation)
1. "Now, sit down again. Move your heels to the macrobeats, and your arms and hands to tap microbeats."

## Notes
Perhaps it's better to not use any words at all. Or many fewer words. And just show the animations. Get out of the left-brain.

But start simple. First create a static, single page. No animations, just words and text going down the screen. Get feedback, than make more interactive.

Also add thank-you notes to contributors at the bottom, people who have helped. Topher, Nathan, etc.

Possibly also a reddit thread to discuss, w/ a note that this section is very much in flux.
